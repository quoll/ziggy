This is a small project to read ZIL files with the aim to convert them into graphs represented in EDN.

A list of some resources can be found on the [Interactive Fiction Wiki](http://www.ifwiki.org/index.php/ZIL).

By coincidence, a lot of information on ZIL [came out recently in 2019](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/04/17/the-source-code-for-the-zork-and-other-infocom-games-using-zil-gaming-vintagecomputing-retrocomputing/) and a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ZILcom/) was started around it as well.

Parsing is being done as a reimplementation of [this paper](https://github.com/heasm66/mdlzork/blob/master/mdlzork_791211/original_source/ppaper.txt?fbclid=IwAR36XdNI5t0k1qXwL074aQ0CaZ8lE2P856r2TZGUqKVrPesVceBw9I-tPrI) from one of the original writers.
